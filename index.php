				Advent of sequencing technology has resulted in rapid development of genome resources. It has offered an opportunity to develop huge data set for even the least studied plants in a single run. Sea buckthorn (Hippophae L.; 2n=24), a member of family Elaegnaceae, is an inhabitant of high mountain ranges and also an ecologically viable and ethnobotanically sustainable food crop (Verma 1998).  Sea buckthorn is one such least studied plant for which limited genomic resources were available until last decade but increasing interest of consumers as well as researcher in its medicinal led to certain significant development in its available genomic resources.  Whole transcriptome sequencing of sea buckthorn (Ghangal et al., 2013) led to development of one of the major sequence resource in sea buckthorn. This sequence data was further exploited. to study the microsatellite distribution in the whole transcriptome (Jain et al., 2014). Development of A user friendly web interface for microsatellite data has wide application for breeders and researchers for better characterization of sea buckthorn.  Apart from it as the microsatellite are from the genic region markers cited here might reflect a direct impact on function characteristic of the plant. The database has wide applications in genome mapping and understanding microsatellite distribution and occurrence in eukaryotic genomes. Database is certain to enrich the limited marker resources available to sea buckthorn community.
